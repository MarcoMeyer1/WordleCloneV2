WordleClone Documentation:

This Android application is a clone of the popular game "Wordle". It allows users to guess a word and receive feedback on their guesses.

   - Users input their guesses via EditText fields and submit them by pressing the "Enter" button.
   - Feedback on the correctness of the guesses is displayed through background colors of the EditText fields.
   - The game ends after six attempts or when the correct word is guessed.
